/* Vertical face counter on the About and Poster pages.
   The rail draws a LOOP, not a line: face N-1 is followed by face 0, so the
   scale it stands for is one whole revolution and the divisor is N, not N-1.
   Dividing by N-1 pinned the last label to 100% — the very same point as 01
   at 0% — and then let the marker run 1/(N-1) of the rail PAST the bottom
   before it wrapped: 66px into empty space with seven faces, 132px with four.
   With N the marker stays inside [0,100%) on its own and 100% IS 0%, so the
   wrap needs no special case.
   The labels are built from the faces instead of being typed into the page,
   so the rail can no longer disagree with the cube about how many there are —
   poster.html had grown to seven faces while the stylesheet still positioned
   four, and 05, 06 and 07 had no `top` at all and piled up on top of 01. */

/* Headroom for the endless roll.
   maintainLoop() fakes an infinite scroll by silently jumping the scroll
   position two revolutions back whenever it comes within one revolution of
   either end of the spacer — and it refuses to do that unless the spacer is
   worth at least five revolutions, because with less there is nowhere safe to
   land. One revolution is `count` viewport-heights, so the height the spacer
   needs is a function of how many items are on the roll.
   It used to be a constant per page with the count of the day baked into it
   (24 viewport-heights for a four-face cube, 42 for a seven-work reel). Going
   from four posters to seven raised the requirement from 20 to 35 while the
   spacer stayed at 24, so the loop quietly switched itself off — no error, the
   scroll just ran to the bottom and stopped dead on the third poster.
   Derive it from the real count instead. Still expressed in vh, so it keeps
   following the viewport on resize exactly as the constant did. */

         the surface goes flat again, and clears the canvas on the way out.
       - Nothing is ever measured. The pointer arrives with offsetX/offsetY,

         transform, so the ripple lands under the cursor without a single

     down, so row 0 of the texture is the picture's foot, the row that touches
     the water. The strips below then map it with one affine transform each:
     a strip is a thin quad with vertical sides, which an affine map covers to
     well under a pixel, and its two edges carry their own heights so the
     picture foreshortens with the frame instead of being pasted on flat.

   Runs on every `.book[data-prefix]` on the page. Pages come from
   data-prefix + data-from..data-to (zero-padded, .jpg) -> spreads.
   Four leaves in two stacks of two: right = [RT (turns next), RU],
   left = [LT (current left page), LU]. A turn rotates RT 0->-180deg
   (Web Animations API, compositor) and LEAVES it there — nothing
   snaps back. RT lifting uncovers RU, which already holds the next
   right page (set a full cycle earlier), so the right page never
   blinks or changes shadow at the hand-off. During the pause the
   leaf now at the BOTTOM of the left stack — occluded both ends —
   is silently carried to the bottom of the right stack and
   re-imaged for two turns ahead. Cast shadow + sheen ride the
   turn's own timeline and end fully transparent before touchdown.

/* ---- 3D / VIDEO page -------------------------------------------------------
   Each clip reveals as it scrolls into view and plays only while it is on
   screen; scrolled away, or with the tab in the background, it pauses. Two
   1080p loops decoding permanently would cost battery for footage nobody is
   looking at.
   Visibility is worked out from the two figures' positions on scroll and
   resize rather than with an IntersectionObserver. An observer delivers
   nothing until the page has rendered a frame, so a tab that opens in the
   background could leave both figures sitting at opacity 0 in their
   letterboxed clip until something woke it; two rectangles read on a
   throttled scroll are cheap and cannot go quiet. It also runs once on load,
   so the first clip is revealed without the reader having to scroll.
   play() returns a promise that rejects if the browser refuses to autoplay;
   that is swallowed, and the frame shows its first picture instead. */
